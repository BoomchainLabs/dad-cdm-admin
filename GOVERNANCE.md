# DAD-CDM Governance
This document defines the DAD-CDM community governance per OASIS Open Projects Governance Policy. This document changes infrequently by the process defined below.

## Overview
DAD-CDM, an OASIS Open Project, is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and self-governing open source community. The community is governed by this document and in accordance with OASIS Open Project Rules with the goal of defining how community should work together to achieve their goals.

## Code Repositories
This document applies to all code repositories under the DAD-CDM github organization that resides at https://github.com/DAD-CDM.

## Project Leadership
DAD-CDM is overseen by the following committees:

**Project Governing Board (PGB)**: Group responsible for the overall lifecycle or business strategy of the project. Oversees activities such as events, marketing, partnerships, promotion, budget, and so forth.

**Technical Steering Committee 1 (Enter Name Once Decided)** -- More information coming soon.

A list of current PGB members can be found here. Technical Steering Committee Members can be found here:

## Community Roles
In addition to the project leadership, important roles may be filled by community members:

**Contributors**: A Contributor is someone who has agreed to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and who makes regular contributions to one or more DAD-CDM projects (including but not limited to activities such as documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participation in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc.). Any person (whether or not an OASIS member or DAD-CDM sponsor) may participate in DAD-CDM as a Contributor. The role of contributor is furthermore defined in the OASIS Open Project Rules.

**Maintainers**: A Maintainer is someone who has agreed to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and has been selected by the TSC to oversee one or more components of an DAD-CDM project, review code and pull requests, prepare releases, triage issues, and similar tasks. Maintainers and their requisite duties are managed by the TSC. Any person (whether or not an OASIS member or DAD-CDM sponsor) may be appointed as a project Maintainer. The role of Maintainer is furthermore defined in the OASIS Open Project Rules.

## Project Governing Board

### Composition

The PGB must at all times have a chair or two co-chairs. The PGB chair or co-chairs are confirmed annually by the PGB itself via a call for nominations, and if required, a full majority vote of the PGB.

### Decisions

For most decisions, the PGB operates by [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html). In addition to the votes required by [OASIS Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process), decisions on the following items require a [full majority vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the PGB:

* Any action or decision that may bind the DAD-CDM project to commitments or obligations with any external party or entity, including but not limited to legal, financial, or intellectual property related commitments or obligations
* Promoting work to an OASIS standards track
* Starting or consuming a new project into the DAD-CDM
* Endorsements, partnerships, or liaisons with other groups
* Substantive changes to the Governance policies or documents
* The TSC recall procedure

## Technical Steering Committees

* Governance of the DAD-CDM Technical Steering Committee can be found [here](https://github.com/DAD-CDM/dad-cdm-admin/blob/main/TSC-CHARTER.md). The DAD-CDM TSC is currently under development. Check back for more information soon.

### Recall Procedure

Any community member may submit a request for recall of a TSC chair to the PGB at any time by submitting the request and sufficient justification to the PGB chair or co-chairs. Such requests shall be held in confidence by the PGB chair or co-chairs. In the event of receipt of such a request, the chair or co-chairs shall schedule the recall as an item for discussion at the next PGB meeting, which shall be held no later than 30 days after the receipt of the request. After subsequent discussion, the recall shall be decided upon by a [full majority vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the PGB. In the event of a recall vote passing, the TSC chair shall at that time be considered immediately recalled and be relieved of all responsibilities conferred via the position.

## Incubation Process
 At this time, new projects are not being considered for inclusion into DAD-CDM. This can change at the sole discretion of the PGB.

## Updating Governance

All substantive changes in Governance require a [full majority vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the PGB.
