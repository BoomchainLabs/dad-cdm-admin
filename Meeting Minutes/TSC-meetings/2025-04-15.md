## Meeting Notes

* Stephen reported on the upcoming presentation to G7 Member States.   
* He also discussed the incident spec, which is in the format consistent with the STIX documentation, but needs more work, particularly on the event context. Stephen plans to incorporate feedback from the CTI TC and turn everything into a STIX bundle within 3-4 weeks.   
* He also discussed the need to align with the CTI TCâ€™s event SDO, which doesn't handle real-world events.  
* Yanis suggested bringing in more technical people and offered to help with the JSON portion of the project.   
* There was a short discussion about potential new TSC members. Rosalie to follow up with Margot on potential candidates.  
* Claudia emphasized the need for the PGB to approve any new additions. The group agreed to keep the PGB informed of any new proposals.  
* Stephen discusses the importance of comprehensive evidence gathering for making a strong case in information manipulation investigations. He emphasizes that observables alone are insufficient, and a wide range of evidence types, including timestamps, name servers, authors, location, and language, are necessary.   
* Stephen plans to present their current thinking on the evidence-based use case for DISARM next week.   
* Rosalie brought up the need to distinguish between circumstantial and concrete evidence in cybersecurity and media campaigns. 

## Action items:

* Rosalie to create a GitHub repository with notebooks for JSON/STIX object creation and validation  
* Rosalie to follow up with Margo about potential new TSC members
