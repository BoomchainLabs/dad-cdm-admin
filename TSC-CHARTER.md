# Charter DAD-CDM Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

## Objectives
The DAD-CDM TSC will be responsible for producing the outputs of the DAD-CDM Project. The PGB defines the work to be carried out by the TSC. The TSC can propose work to be carried out to the PGB. This might include definitions for a set of data objects and properties, as well as taxonomies and a lexicon, which together and in combination with STIX, can be used for the goals of modeling influence threats, capturing, and sharing intelligence on disinformation threats at speed and scale, and over the long-term also of modeling strategic, operational, and tactical responses to these threats. The intention is first to assess the applicability of existing STIX objects in achieving these goals and to identify gaps which prevent the current version of STIX from achieving these goals. 

## Scope
The scope of the TSC is creating/maintaining all work products within the scope of the [DAD-CDM project](https://github.com/DAD-CDM/dad-cdm-admin/blob/main/CHARTER.md). The PGB defines the scope of the work of the TSC. The work of the TSC needs to be approved by the PGB. For example, it is suggested that some initial work be done to gather an inventory of existing disinformation-related lexicons, an inventory of existing disinformation-related data models, and an inventory of existing disinformation-related data sources. This will help establish the outer contours of the problem we seek to address. At the opposite end of the spectrum, it is suggested that we catalog all existing attempts to extend STIX for the purposes of modeling and responding to disinformation threats. This will help to establish the low-hanging fruit in which we can capitalize on existing work without reinventing the wheel. This data gathering will inform the PGB as it defines and prioritizes the scope of the TSC’s work. 
    
## Knowledge and Skills
The TSC will bring together three different types of knowledge: (1) the knowledge acquired by researchers, investigative journalists, and policy analysts who regularly track and expose deliberate threats to the integrity of the public sphere and recommend policy responses, (2) the knowledge acquired by data scientists who have experience characterizing and modeling the most common aspects of these threats and defender responses, and (3) the knowledge acquired by threat analysts and programmers who have experience developing and using the STIX and TAXII standards and related tools to codify and share cyber threat intelligence and orchestrate automated or semi-automated responses.         
     
## Composition
The DAD-CDM Technical Steering Committee will be composed of at least 5 Members (with a maximum of 11), one of whom will serve as TSC Chair or two as TSC Co-Chairs. The TSC will elect one of its members to act as its voting representative on the PGB by Full Majority Vote. The Chair will notify the PGB of the committee's choice. In the scenario where the TSC voting representative also holds a position as a PGB voting member, this does not grant an additional voting privilege.  

## Start-Up Phase
The initial membership of the TSC will be recruited and appointed by the Project Governing Board, who will also appoint one of the members Chair or Co-Chair. The term for serving on the TSC is one year.

## Ongoing Membership
After the TSC is initially formed, it will hold annual elections of members and selection of the Chair, starting in November 2024. A call for nominations will be sent out to the community of interest at least two weeks before the election is held. Current members of the TSC may volunteer to continue their service. Members will be elected for a one-year term.

The vote will be by electronic ballot. The TSC or PGB may request that OASIS staff carry out the vote. Eligible voters will be contributors to the project who have had a pull request approved or made other contributions to the project during the previous year. The TSC Chairs or Secretary, should one be appointed for the committee, will be responsible for maintaining the list of eligible voters.

The ballot will remain open for 7 days. Voters will select 5 candidates and a further six in priority order to take the TSC up to a maximum 11, with a list of others in reserve for those who are not willing/able to accept the request.

Once 5 have agreed, the first TSC meeting can take place, and the TSC will take responsibility for the remainder of the initial process and for the ongoing membership of the TSC – including the creation of TSC sub-groups, with the approval of the PGB.

## Requirements
TSC members must have signed and submitted an [individual CLA](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/cla/oasis-open-projects-individual-contributor-license-agreement-i-cla/), and if appointed by an entity, that entity must have signed and submitted an [entity CLA](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/cla/entity-cla-20210630/). A list of TSC members shall be maintained and posted at the general information web page designated by OASIS for the Project.

## Attendance Policy
TSC members are expected to attend the meetings on a regular basis and should send a notice to the chair(s) if they cannot attend a meeting. A TSC member can’t miss more than 3 consecutive meetings without prior notice. 

PGB Chairs reserve the right to remove TSC members for persistent non-attendance.

## Removal
A TSC member is eligible to lose their seat for violating the Code of Conduct through a simple majority vote of TSC members that are not being considered for removal.

After removal, a special election shall be governed by OASIS for the vacant seat among contributors. The seat will be up for re-election at the next regular election cycle.

The PGB of the DAD-CDM Open Project has the option to consider extenuating circumstances and determine whether or not to remove a member, if the TSC itself cannot come to a determination.

## Updating Governance
All substantive changes in Governance require a [full majority vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the TSC and subsequent approval of the PGB.
